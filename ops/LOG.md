# OPS LOG

Append-only. Newest at the top. Never edit or delete an earlier entry — a wrong
entry gets a correction below it, not a rewrite. Every entry carries the
evidence that lets the other agent reproduce the check.

## 2026-07-30-C4 · Codex · Public-safe shared charter added

**Claim and scope.** Claimed OPS-CHARTER-001 on the board and pushed commit
`60b93cf` before editing. Read the complete private local charter, then created
`ops/CHARTER.md` as the safe subset needed by cloud Claude in this public
repository.

**Included.** Shared mission, precedence, one-task claim protocol, safe
autonomous work, task-specific approval requirements, human-only security
gates, honesty and evidence standards, lead/form delivery proof, outreach
limits, untrusted-content handling, public-repository privacy, and the
completion standard.

**Deliberately omitted.** Private approvals, contact lists, account details,
inbox contents, pricing or margin data, personal information, and machine
security state. The charter explicitly says that omitted permission is not
authorization.

**Wiring.** Added the charter to `ops/README.md`, added a startup instruction in
root `CLAUDE.md`, marked OPS-CHARTER-001 complete, and updated the current
handoff. A scan found no email address, phone number, known private address,
credential-shaped value, or other known sensitive literal in the charter.

## 2026-07-30-C5 · Claude · Correction: my diagnosis of the form was wrong

**Codex's C3 corrects me, and the correction matters.** Recording it here rather
than quietly moving on.

- **What I got right, and it was verified:** Netlify has zero forms registered
  for `candid-starship-c2ce98`, so smithdigitalco.com is capturing nothing. That
  came from the API and it held up.
- **What I got wrong:** I proposed the fix was to add `data-netlify="true"` and
  a hidden `form-name` input to the HTML, and wrote that into
  `HANDOFF-TO-CODEX.md` and the board as *the* fix. Codex opened the actual file
  and found all of it already present — `name="audit-request"`,
  `data-netlify="true"`, matching hidden `form-name`, honeypot. Local file
  52,858 bytes, SHA-256 `e627397…`.
- **The real cause:** the wrong file is deployed. Live is 23,205 bytes, SHA-256
  `88914d8…`, zero `<form>` elements, old placeholder content. The corrected
  page was simply never published.

I was reasoning about a file I could not open. The reasoning was sound and the
conclusion was wrong, which is the failure mode worth naming: a plausible cause
stated confidently is still a guess. Codex had the file and checked. Anyone
reading the earlier entries should treat my proposed HTML fix as superseded.

**On the blocker.** Codex is stopped because Chrome won't let it attach a file
without the ChatGPT extension's *Allow access to file URLs*. Steen can flip that
in 30 seconds.

**Whether Claude could route around it — checked, and deliberately not
attempted.** Claude does hold a Netlify `deploy-site` tool. Two reasons it was
not used:

1. Claude does not have the file. It lives on the Windows machine and is in no
   repository Claude can reach.
2. The tool's schema accepts only `siteId` — nothing that names a source
   directory. It would presumably publish this container's working directory,
   which is the **Smith Made** website. Running it against Smith Digital's site
   ID could have replaced smithdigitalco.com with Smith Made's homepage.

That is a live example of why the charter says confirm before publishing. The
tool was available, the task was authorized, and using it would have broken a
different business's website. Not attempted, and not to be attempted from a
cloud container without a way to specify the source directory.

**The clean unblock, for whoever gets there first:** local Claude on the Windows
machine would have both the file and control of the working directory, and
publishes through the API rather than a browser file picker — so the Chrome
extension permission stops mattering entirely. Steen has already approved that
install.

**Handoff unchanged in substance:** SD-FORMS-001 stays Codex's, still BLOCKED,
and the fix is a deploy of the existing local file rather than any edit to it.
Claude will re-query Netlify form registration once a deploy lands.

**Renumbered C4 → C5.** Codex and Claude each wrote a `C4` entry at the same
position in this file within the same minute. Git raised it as a merge conflict
and it was resolved by hand, keeping both entries intact. That is the collision
described in `BRIEF-FOR-CODEX-LOCAL-CLAUDE.md` §4, happening for real on the
same day it was written about — and it surfaced *only* because the two agents
are on separate machines and had to pass through git. On one shared filesystem
there is no merge, no conflict, and no warning: the second write would simply
have replaced the first, and the lost entry would never have been noticed.

## 2026-07-30-C2 · Claude · The bridge carried its first message back

**What happened.** A push was rejected as non-fast-forward. On fetch, the remote
branch had a commit Claude did not write: `597c20a` *"Claim Smith Digital form
deployment"*, authored 2026-07-30 15:13 PDT from the Windows machine.

The diff was one line of `ops/AGENT_BOARD.md`:

```
- **Status: OPEN · Owner: CODEX · Priority: highest · Found by Claude 2026-07-30**
+ **Status: ACTIVE · Owner: CODEX · Priority: highest · Claimed 2026-07-30 15:13 PDT**
```

**Why it matters.** SD-FORMS-001 was written by Claude, pushed, pulled on the
other machine, read, and claimed — with a timestamp, before any work started,
which is the protocol in `README.md` §4. The channel works in both directions,
and the claim arrived as a lock rather than as a status update after the fact.

**Precisely what did not happen.** No conversation. Claude did not know the
claim existed until a push failed and a fetch showed it. There is no
notification in either direction — a rejected push was the only signal. That is
the whole mechanism, and it is worth stating plainly because it is easy to
narrate this as two agents coordinating in real time. They did not. One wrote a
file; the other found it later by colliding with it.

**Resolution.** Claude rebased onto `597c20a` rather than merging or forcing.
The two edits touched different sections of `AGENT_BOARD.md` and merged
cleanly. Verified after rebase that Codex's claim line survived intact —
checked, not assumed, since a rebase is exactly where another agent's edit
would quietly disappear.

**Note for the record.** Commits from the Windows machine are authored
`Steen Smith <steenbballsmith@gmail.com>` — that is the git identity configured
on that PC, not evidence of who or what composed the change.

**Also in this unit.** Wrote `ops/BRIEF-FOR-CODEX-LOCAL-CLAUDE.md` — what
installing Claude locally changes for each agent. Its main point is a warning
rather than a benefit: the git round-trip has been preventing collisions by
being slow, and a shared filesystem removes that protection while keeping the
silence. This entry is a live example — the collision was caught here only
because git refused the push. On one filesystem there is no such refusal.

## 2026-07-30-C3 · Codex · Smith Digital form source verified; deploy blocked before upload

**Branch handoff received.** Fetched and checked out
`claude/codex-team-coordination-shomkq`, read `ops/README.md` and
`ops/HANDOFF-TO-CODEX.md`, claimed SD-FORMS-001 on the board, committed the
claim as `597c20a`, and pushed it before attempting the external action.

**Local source evidence.**
- `C:\Users\SJ\Smith-Digital-Site\index.html` is 52,858 bytes, SHA-256
  `e6273977584b4032deec4ddbd002c3c7332aec0cc1cd63b3f5fd906a32fe73bc`.
- It contains one native POST form with `name="audit-request"`,
  `data-netlify="true"`, a matching hidden
  `name="form-name" value="audit-request"`, and
  `netlify-honeypot="company-website-hp"`.
- Conclusion: Claude's required form structure is already present locally. The
  defect is that the corrected local file is not the file currently deployed.

**Live evidence.**
- A fresh HTTPS fetch returned 200, 23,205 bytes, SHA-256
  `88914d825e65c6339c008ea1bd2e16d89ff86dd9320492ba8f2df033622c7c80`.
- The fetched live HTML contains zero `<form>` elements, no `audit-request`,
  and still contains the old proof-placeholder content.
- The signed-in Netlify dashboard still identifies production deploy
  `6a6a34440418d1b5f6dc57e0` as the latest deploy.

**Deploy attempt and blocker.**
- Opened the signed-in deploy page for `candid-starship-c2ce98` and selected
  its single-file upload path.
- Chrome stopped before a file could be attached because the ChatGPT Chrome
  Extension lacks **Allow access to file URLs**.
- No file was uploaded, no deploy started, and the live site was not changed.
- Human handoff: on the home computer, open `chrome://extensions`, open Details
  for the ChatGPT Chrome Extension, enable **Allow access to file URLs**, and
  tell Codex `Chrome file access is enabled`.

**Next verification after that toggle.** Codex deploys the already-correct
local `index.html`, verifies the live HTML contains the form, and leaves Claude
an updated log signal to re-query Netlify form registration. SD-FORMS-002 and
SD-FORMS-003 remain blocked until registration is proven.

## 2026-07-30-C1 · Claude · Bridge established, Smith Digital reconciled

**Context.** Steen asked Claude and Codex to work as one team, and passed along
Codex's operating instructions. Those instructions asked Claude to read eight
files under `C:\Users\SJ\.claude\ops\`, deploy a file from
`C:\Users\SJ\Smith-Digital-Site\`, and verify a live URL.

**Environment check — done first, before acting.**
- `pwd` → `/home/user/Smith-made`. Linux container, not Steen's PC.
- `ls "/mnt/c/Users/SJ/.claude/ops"` → no such file or directory. Same for
  `~/.claude/ops`. **None of the eight files are reachable.**
- `list_repos` → exactly one repository in scope,
  `steenbballsmith-source/Smith-made`. The Smith Digital source is not in it.
- `git log --all --diff-filter=A` for `CHARTER|AGENT_BOARD|COLLAB|ops` → nothing.
  No ops file has ever been committed to this repo.
- `curl https://smithdigitalco.com` → `CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403`.
  Same for the `.netlify.app` permalink. The outbound proxy blocks both, which
  matches the known constraint in `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` §6. **Claude cannot see
  the live site.**

**Netlify reconciliation — what the API says.**
- Authenticated as steenbballsmith@gmail.com. Project `candid-starship-c2ce98`
  exists, site ID `392091e9-6dc3-4a3d-8f84-d2e400d3169b`, domain
  `smithdigitalco.com` bound and primary.
- Live deploy `6a6a34440418d1b5f6dc57e0`, state `ready`, published
  **2026-07-29 17:11:34 UTC** — a day before Claude was asked to deploy it.
  `deploy_source: "drop"`, `manual_deploy: true`, one file, `index.html`.
- **`get-forms-for-project` → `[]`.** Zero forms registered, despite the Forms
  feature being enabled.

**Findings.**
1. SD-DEPLOY-001 was already complete. Claude did not re-deploy — that would
   have been a duplicate deployment. Claude also could not have: the source file
   is on the Windows machine.
2. The audit form is not wired to Netlify Forms. Submissions on smithdigitalco.com
   are being captured nowhere. Notifications cannot be attached to a form that
   does not exist, and a test submission would not arrive. Opened as
   **SD-FORMS-001**, owned by Codex, who has the file and a browser.
3. Netlify notification configuration is not in Claude's toolset at all — the
   MCP server offers enable/disable and submission read/delete, nothing more.
   Opened as **SD-FORMS-002** for Steen or Codex.
4. Public-repo exposure of the lead lists, founder discount, and margin floor.
   Opened as **OPS-PRIVACY-001** for Steen. Not an agent's decision to make.

**Actions taken.** Created `ops/` — this log, `AGENT_BOARD.md`, `README.md`
(the bridge protocol), and `HANDOFF-TO-CODEX.md`. Pushed to
`claude/codex-team-coordination-shomkq`.

**Not done, deliberately.**
- No deploy — already done by someone else.
- No form notification config — not possible with available tools.
- No test submission — it would have proven nothing while SD-FORMS-001 is open,
  and a 200 response would have looked like success.
- No venue email, draft, or contact. SM-PR-001 is Codex's.
- No `CHARTER.md` written. It is Codex's artifact; a second copy is worse than
  none.

**Correction to the record.** Claude and Codex have not communicated. Everything
above is state shared through files in git — nothing was agreed between agents.

**Next.** Codex takes SD-FORMS-001. Details in `HANDOFF-TO-CODEX.md`.
